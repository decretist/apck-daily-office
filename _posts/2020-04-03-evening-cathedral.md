I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.
*Psalm li.* 3.

To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we
have rebelled against him; neither have we obeyed the voice of the
LORD our God, to walk in his laws which he set before us.
*Dan. ix.* 9, 10.

If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth
is not in us; but if we confess our sins, God is faithful and just
to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
*1 St. John i.* 8, 9.

LET us humbly confess our sins unto Almighty God.

*A General Confession.*

ALMIGHTY and most merciful Father; We have erred, and strayed from
thy ways like lost sheep. We have followed too much the devices and
desires of our own hearts. We have offended against thy holy laws.
We have left undone those things which we ought to have done; And
we have done those things which we ought not to have done; And there
is no health in us. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable
offenders. Spare thou those, O God, who confess their faults. Restore
thou those who are penitent; According to thy promises declared
unto mankind in Christ Jesus our Lord. And grant, O most merciful
Father, for his sake; That we may hereafter live a godly, righteous,
and sober life, To the glory of thy holy Name. Amen.

OUR Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom
come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation; But
deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and
the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.

*Minister.* O Lord, open thou our lips.  
*Answer.* And our mouth shall show forth thy praise.  

*Minister.* Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;  
*Answer.* As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.  
*Minister.* Praise ye the Lord.  
*Answer.* The Lordâ€™s Name be praised.  

**Psalm 139**

O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me.  
Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.  
Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.  
For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.  
Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.  
Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.  
Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?  
If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.  
If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;  
Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.  
If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.  
Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.  
For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.  
I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.  
My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.  
Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.  
How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!  
If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.  
Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.  
For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.  
Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?  
I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.  
Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:  
And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.  

*Gloria in excelsis.*

GLORY be to God on high, and on earth peace, good will towards men.
We praise thee, we bless thee, we worship thee, we glorify thee,
we give thanks to thee for thy great glory, O Lord God, heavenly
King, God the Father Almighty.  
O Lord, the only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ; O Lord God, Lamb of
God, Son of the Father, that takest away the sins of the world,
have mercy upon us. Thou that takest away the sins of the world,
receive our prayer. Thou that sittest at the right hand of God the
Father, have mercy upon us.  
For thou only art holy; thou only art the Lord; thou only, O Christ,
with the Holy Ghost, art most high in the glory of God the Father.
Amen.  

Here beginneth the thirty-sixth verse of the thirty-second chapter of the Book of the Prophet Jeremiah:

And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning
this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of
the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the
pestilence; Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither
I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great
wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause
them to dwell safely: And they shall be my people, and I will be
their God: And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they
may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children
after them: And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that
I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my
fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me. Yea, I
will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in
this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.
For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great evil
upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I
have promised them.

Here endeth the First Lesson.

*Magnificat.* St. Luke i. 46.

MY soul doth magnify the Lord, * and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.  
For he hath regarded * the lowliness of his handmaiden.  
For behold, from henceforth * all generations shall call me blessed.  
For he that is mighty hath magnified me; * and holy is his Name.  
And his mercy is on them that fear him * throughout all generations.  
He hath showed strength with his arm; * he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.  
He hath put down the mighty from their seat, * and hath exalted the humble and meek.  
He hath filled the hungry with good things; * and the rich he hath sent empty away.  
He remembering his mercy hath holpen his servant Israel; * as he promised to our forefathers, Abraham and his seed, for ever.  

Here beginneth the forty-fourth verse of the twelfth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John:

Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me,
but on him that sent me. And he that seeth me seeth him that sent
me. I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on
me should not abide in darkness. And if any man hear my words, and
believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world,
but to save the world. He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my
words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the
same shall judge him in the last day. For I have not spoken of
myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment,
what I should say, and what I should speak. And I know that his
commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even
as the Father said unto me, so I speak.

Here endeth the Second Lesson.

*Nunc dimittis.* St. Luke ii. 29.

LORD, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, * according to thy word.  
For mine eyes have seen * thy salvation,  
Which thou hast prepared * before the face of all people;  
To be a light to lighten the Gentiles, * and to be the glory of thy people Israel.

I BELIEVE in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth:  
And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord: Who was conceived by the
Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary: Suffered under Pontius Pilate,
Was crucified, dead, and buried: He descended into hell; The third
day he rose again from the dead: He ascended into heaven, And sitteth
on the right hand of God the Father Almighty: From thence he shall
come to judge the quick and the dead.  
I believe in the Holy Ghost: The holy Catholic Church; The Communion
of Saints: The Forgiveness of sins: The Resurrection of the body:
And the Life everlasting. Amen.

*Answer.* And with thy spirit.  
*Minister.* Let us pray.

WE beseech thee, Almighty God, mercifully to look upon thy people;
that by thy great goodness they may be governed and preserved
evermore, both in body and soul; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
*Amen.*

ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, who hatest nothing that thou hast
made, and dost forgive the sins of all those who are penitent;
Create and make in us new and contrite hearts, that we,worthily
lamenting our sins and acknowledging our wretchedness, may obtain
of thee, the God of all mercy, perfect remission and forgiveness;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. *Amen.*

*A Collect for Peace.*

O GOD, from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and all just
works do proceed; Give unto thy servants that peace which the world
cannot give; that our hearts may be set to obey thy commandments,
and also that by thee, we, being defended from the fear of our
enemies, may pass our time in rest and quietness; through the merits
of Jesus Christ our Saviour. *Amen.*

*A Collect for Aid against Perils.*

LIGHTEN our darkness, we beseech thee, O Lord; and by thy great
mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this night; for the
love of thy only Son, our Saviour, Jesus Christ. *Amen.*

*In Time of Calamity.*

O GOD, merciful and compassionate, who art ever ready to hear the
prayers of those who put their trust in thee; Graciously hearken
to us who call upon thee, and grant us thy help in this our need;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. *Amen.*

*In Time of Great Sickness and Mortality.*

O MOST mighty and merciful God, in this time of grievous sickness,
we flee unto thee for succour. Deliver us, we beseech thee, from
our peril; give strength and skill to all those who minister to the
sick; prosper the means made use of for their cure; and grant that,
perceiving how frail and uncertain our life is, we may apply our
hearts unto that heavenly wisdom which leadeth to eternal life;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. *Amen.*

*2 Cor. xiii. 14.*

THE grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.
