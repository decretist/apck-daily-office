I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.
*Psalm li.* 3.

To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we
have rebelled against him; neither have we obeyed the voice of the
LORD our God, to walk in his laws which he set before us.
*Dan. ix.* 9, 10.

If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth
is not in us; but if we confess our sins, God is faithful and just
to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
*1 St. John i.* 8, 9.

LET us humbly confess our sins unto Almighty God.

*A General Confession.*

ALMIGHTY and most merciful Father; We have erred, and strayed from
thy ways like lost sheep. We have followed too much the devices and
desires of our own hearts. We have offended against thy holy laws.
We have left undone those things which we ought to have done; And
we have done those things which we ought not to have done; And there
is no health in us. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us, miserable
offenders. Spare thou those, O God, who confess their faults. Restore
thou those who are penitent; According to thy promises declared
unto mankind in Christ Jesus our Lord. And grant, O most merciful
Father, for his sake; That we may hereafter live a godly, righteous,
and sober life, To the glory of thy holy Name. Amen.

OUR Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom
come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive
those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation; But
deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and
the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.

*Minister.* O Lord, open thou our lips.  
*Answer.* And our mouth shall show forth thy praise.  

*Minister.* Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;  
*Answer.* As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.  
*Minister.* Praise ye the Lord.  
*Answer.* The Lordâ€™s Name be praised.  

**Psalm 145**

I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.  
Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.  
Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable.  
One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.  
I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works.  
And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness.  
They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness.  
The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy.  
The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.  
All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee.  
They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power;  
To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.  
Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.  
The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down.  
The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season.  
Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.  
The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.  
The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.  
He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.  
The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.  
My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.  

*Gloria in excelsis.*

GLORY be to God on high, and on earth peace, good will towards men.
We praise thee, we bless thee, we worship thee, we glorify thee,
we give thanks to thee for thy great glory, O Lord God, heavenly
King, God the Father Almighty.  
O Lord, the only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ; O Lord God, Lamb of
God, Son of the Father, that takest away the sins of the world,
have mercy upon us. Thou that takest away the sins of the world,
receive our prayer. Thou that sittest at the right hand of God the
Father, have mercy upon us.  
For thou only art holy; thou only art the Lord; thou only, O Christ,
with the Holy Ghost, art most high in the glory of God the Father.
Amen.  

Here beginneth the thirty-third chapter of the Book of the Prophet Jeremiah:

Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time,
while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying, Thus
saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to
establish it; the LORD is his name; Call unto me, and I will answer
thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest
not. For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the
houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of
Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword; They
come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is fill them with the dead
bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and
for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city. Behold,
I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will
reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth. And I will cause
the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and
will build them, as at the first. And I will cleanse them from all
their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will
pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby
they have transgressed against me. And it shall be to me a name of
joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth,
which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and they shall
fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity
that I procure unto it. Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that
I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house
of Israel and to the house of Judah. In those days, and at that
time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto
David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.
In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely:
and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The LORD our
righteousness.

Here endeth the First Lesson.

*Magnificat.* St. Luke i. 46.

MY soul doth magnify the Lord, * and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.  
For he hath regarded * the lowliness of his handmaiden.  
For behold, from henceforth * all generations shall call me blessed.  
For he that is mighty hath magnified me; * and holy is his Name.  
And his mercy is on them that fear him * throughout all generations.  
He hath showed strength with his arm; * he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.  
He hath put down the mighty from their seat, * and hath exalted the humble and meek.  
He hath filled the hungry with good things; * and the rich he hath sent empty away.  
He remembering his mercy hath holpen his servant Israel; * as he promised to our forefathers, Abraham and his seed, for ever.  

Here beginneth the thirteenth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John:

Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour
was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father,
having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto
the end. And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the
heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him; Jesus knowing
that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he
was come from God, and went to God; He riseth from supper, and laid
aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself. After
that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples'
feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. Then
cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou
wash my feet? Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou
knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. Peter saith unto
him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash
thee not, thou hast no part with me. Simon Peter saith unto him,
Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. Jesus saith
to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but
is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. For he knew who
should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. So after
he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set
down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?  Ye
call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. If I then,
your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash
one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should
do as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant
is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than
he that sent him. If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do
them.

Here endeth the Second Lesson.

*Nunc dimittis.* St. Luke ii. 29.

LORD, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, * according to thy word.  
For mine eyes have seen * thy salvation,  
Which thou hast prepared * before the face of all people;  
To be a light to lighten the Gentiles, * and to be the glory of thy people Israel.

I BELIEVE in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth:  
And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord: Who was conceived by the
Holy Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary: Suffered under Pontius Pilate,
Was crucified, dead, and buried: He descended into hell; The third
day he rose again from the dead: He ascended into heaven, And sitteth
on the right hand of God the Father Almighty: From thence he shall
come to judge the quick and the dead.  
I believe in the Holy Ghost: The holy Catholic Church; The Communion
of Saints: The Forgiveness of sins: The Resurrection of the body:
And the Life everlasting. Amen.

ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, who hatest nothing that thou hast
made, and dost forgive the sins of all those who are penitent;
Create and make in us new and contrite hearts, that we,worthily
lamenting our sins and acknowledging our wretchedness, may obtain
of thee, the God of all mercy, perfect remission and forgiveness;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. *Amen.*

*A Collect for Peace.*

O GOD, from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and all just
works do proceed; Give unto thy servants that peace which the world
cannot give; that our hearts may be set to obey thy commandments,
and also that by thee, we, being defended from the fear of our
enemies, may pass our time in rest and quietness; through the merits
of Jesus Christ our Saviour. *Amen.*

*A Collect for Aid against Perils.*

LIGHTEN our darkness, we beseech thee, O Lord; and by thy great
mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this night; for the
love of thy only Son, our Saviour, Jesus Christ. *Amen.*

*In Time of Calamity.*

O GOD, merciful and compassionate, who art ever ready to hear the
prayers of those who put their trust in thee; Graciously hearken
to us who call upon thee, and grant us thy help in this our need;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. *Amen.*

*In Time of Great Sickness and Mortality.*

O MOST mighty and merciful God, in this time of grievous sickness,
we flee unto thee for succour. Deliver us, we beseech thee, from
our peril; give strength and skill to all those who minister to the
sick; prosper the means made use of for their cure; and grant that,
perceiving how frail and uncertain our life is, we may apply our
hearts unto that heavenly wisdom which leadeth to eternal life;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. *Amen.*

*2 Cor. xiii. 14.*

THE grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.
