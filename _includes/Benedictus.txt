*Benedictus es Domine.*

BLESSED art thou, O Lord God of our fathers; * praised and exalted above all for ever.  
Blessed art thou for the Name of thy Majesty; * praised and exalted above all for ever.  
Blessed art thou in the temple of thy holiness; * Praised and exalted above all for ever.  
Blessed art thou that beholdest the depths, and dwellest between the Cherubim: * praised and exalted above all for ever.  
Blessed art thou on the glorious throne of thy Kingdom: * praised and exalted above all for ever.  
Blessed art thou in the firmament of heaven: * praised and exalted above all for ever.
